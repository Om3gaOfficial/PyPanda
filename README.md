`PyPanda` is an easy to use [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) based library providing simple and easy access to the API of [Bitpanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/) and [Bitpanda Pro](https://www.bitpanda.com/pro).

`PyPanda` will be updated regularly and will someday have all features implemented as an trouble-free to use function.
